# FizzBuzz_9000

I've never done FizzBUzz... THere's a simple solution to that.. and it shall be done in many styles and languages

# 9000... ?

I'm curious as to how many different ways there are to write FizzBuzz. It is a good challenge I think, to write it in many diffrent ways... In this manner I can practice programming and exert my brain to think and code in differen ways... perhaps I will find useful methods while doing this
